#Project Overview
This project is a part of my internship experience focused on applying machine learning techniques to analyze and predict stock market trends. The goal is to build predictive models that can forecast stock prices or market movements based on historical data, technical indicators, and other relevant features.

Key Features
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Gathered historical stock price data, cleaned and transformed it for analysis. Handled missing values, normalized features, and created time-series datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized stock price trends, volume, moving averages, and other technical indicators to understand market behavior and identify patterns.

Feature Engineering:
Created technical indicators such as Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and others to enrich the dataset.

Model Development:
Implemented and compared various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time-series forecasting.

Model Evaluation:
Used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess model performance.

Visualization:
Plotted predicted vs actual stock prices to evaluate model accuracy and visualize forecasting results.

Technologies & Tools
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)

Jupyter Notebook
